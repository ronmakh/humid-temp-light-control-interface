# temp-humid-light-control-interface

## Description

This embedded programming project is created to create a C# user interface to an Arduino Mega to control condition in a ultra high-precision surface measurement and analysis machine.

This project does the following functions:
- Control the light RGB and intensity
- Measure humidity in machine
- Measure temperature in machine

Key files in repo:
- C# user interface: `interface-screenshot.png`
- C# code directory: `../Arduino and Visual Basic Part 2/Arduino and Visual Basic Part 2/Form1.vb`
- Arduino code directory: `../Arduino_to_Visual_Basic_002_-_Receiving_Data_From_the_Arduino/Arduino_to_Visual_Basic_002_-_Receiving_Data_From_the_Arduino.ino`

## Requirements
1. Install .NET environment in your machine. (Recommended to use Visual Studio to easily set up .NET environment and design the C# UI)
2. Install Arduino IDE or install C++ environment in your machne to code the Arduino program.

## Steps to Run
1. Run `Arduino and Visual Basic Part 2.exe`

## Project History

This project is done as part of work with an engineering company focusing on hardware precision back in 2020. The project was created to detect humidity level and temperature in an ultra-high precision machine, and to use light intensity to manually control the conditions in the machine.

Code has not been maintained since completion in 2020, apart from documentation and minor code clean-ups.
